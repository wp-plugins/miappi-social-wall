Show all your Social feeds and hashtag content in one widget.

== Description ==

Miappi is a social media enhancement platform. Use Miappi to unite all your social media accounts into an awesome 'social wall'. Embed that social wall on any website.  Choose from Standard (FREE), Professional or Enterprise accounts. 


Here's what you can add to your social wall:

1. Your own social media feeds from Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, SoundCloud, Tumblr and RSS
2. Third party content from ANY supported social media feed that's public. That means you can amplify your own voice with great content cherry-picked from other brands, celebrities or people posting to a social network. 
3. User generated content (UGC) conversations via hashtags.  We support hashtag conversations from Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Don't cannibalize your own traffic by sending visitors off to the social networks via those cute little icons on your website. Once they've gone they may not come back!

With Miappi you have every post, tweet, image, video and #tag campaign in one place (on your website!) so your audience engages with more of your social content without having to leave your site to visit the social networks.
